/* This kata is all about adding numbers.

You will create a function named add. It will return the sum of all the arguments. Sounds easy, doesn't it?

Well Here's the Twist. The inputs will gradually decrease with their index as parameter to the function.

  add(3,4,6); 
  /*
  returns ( 3 / 1 ) + ( 4 / 2 ) + ( 6 / 3 ) = 7
  */

  //solution

  const add = (...args) =>
  Math.round(args.reduce((pre, val, idx) => pre + val / ++idx, 0));
